•   You   would   engage   in   financial   exchange   only   if the   utility   of what   you   expect   to   get   back   in   the   future   is   at   least   as   much   as   the   utility   of what   you   are   giving   up   today.

•   This   course   is   about   investing   in   (buying   and   selling)   financial   assets   (aka   securities,   financial instruments,   financial   contracts,   etc.).
Financial Institutions and Markets 
•   Financial   institutions   (e.g.,   banks,   credit   unions,   stock   brokers,   investment   bankers,   mutual funds,   pension   funds,   insurance   companies,   etc.)   facilitate   financial   exchange.
•   Financial   markets   are   made   up   of individuals   and   institutions who trade   (engage   in   financial   exchange)   with   each   other.
•   Financial   markets   channel   resources   (money)   to   most   productive   real   assets.   In   the   process,   they   lead   to   price   discover代 写FIN 346 Spring 2025, Investments

•   They   allow   for   separation   of ownership   and   management.
Investment Preferences 
•   Good   companies   and   good   investments: Socially   Responsible   Investing, ESG   investing. 
•   Be   skeptical   of claims   by   companies.
•   Corporate   governance   and   shareholder   activism.
•   Generally,   if   you   don’t   like   what   the   company   is   doing,   invest   in   another   one.
•   Financial   Crisis   of   2008–2009:    Asymmetric   information,    divergent   incentives,   hubris.      Well explained   in   the   Bird   and   Fortune   videos.
Risk and Expected Return 
•   Different market participants have different   tolerance   for   risk.    Those with high   risk   tolerance   are   willing   to   invest   in   high-risk   securities   with   higher   expected   returns   while   others   invest   in   low-risk   securities   with   low   expected   returns.
◦   A   higher   expected   return,   a   higher   return   on   an   average,   is   the   reward   (compensation)   for   risk.    But   there   are   no   guarantees   that   investing   in   a   high   risk   security   will   always   lead   to   a   higher   average   return,   even   in   a   very   long   run.   That’s   the   risk.

Investment Mechanics for Individuals 
•   Open   an   account   with   a   broker   such   as   Schwab,   Fidelity,   Vanguard,   Robinhood.
◦   In   some   cases,   you   may   be   able   to   invest   without   going   through   a   broker.      Examples:   Mutual   funds, https://www.treasurydirect.gov.
•   Fund   the   account   by   depositing   some   money.
•   Place   orders   for   ETFs,   mutual   funds,   stocks,   etc.   Later   expand   to   more   sophisticated   invest-   ments.
Investment Decisions 
•   Asset   allocation:   How   much   in   different   asset   classes   (risk-free   vs   risky;   risky:   stocks,   bonds,   cash,   real   estate,   crypto,   international   vs   domestic,   etc.)
•   Security selection:   Securities within asset classes   (top down) or just   selection based   on   knowl-   edge   and   interest   (bottom   up).
•   Collecting   information   and   analyzing   to   decide   when   and   how   much   to   invest   in   each   security.
Investing in Competitive Markets 
•   Prices   are   correct   for   the   most   part.      There   is   very   little   mispricing.      Even   if   there   is,   by   the   time   you   react   to   it,   it   would   be   too   late.      Sometimes   you   will   get   lucky.      Enjoy   those   moments.   Don’t   let   them   go   to   your   head.
